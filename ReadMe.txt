PROJECT: Remote access to edge devices using RabbitMQ

PROJECT TITLE: Gate Master(remote control solution for IoT gateways

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 Traditional methods of managing IoT gateways are inefficient and insecure. A robust, user-friendly remote access module that allows administrators to manage IoT gateways effortlessly from a mobile application

System Architecture:

Raspberry Pi Setup:

Data Collection: Use sensors to collect data on the Raspberry Pi.
Data Processing: Process data locally as needed before sending.
Message Queue: Use RabbitMQ to queue messages.

RabbitMQ Configuration:

Queues: Define specific queues for different types of messages (e.g., sensor data, alerts, commands).
Exchanges: Use direct, topic, or fanout exchanges based on the routing needs.

Mobile Application:

Background Service: Implement background services to listen for incoming messages.
Data Handling: Parse and process received messages appropriately.
UI Updates: Update the user interface based on the data received.
Notifications: Use push notifications for important alerts.
Remote Commands: Allow users to send commands back to the Raspberry Pi.

MILESTONES:
creating a module for remote access
app development
creating a home automation system
acheiving the remote access
